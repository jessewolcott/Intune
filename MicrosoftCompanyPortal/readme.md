Thanks to the death of the Microsoft Store for Business, we use winget now! This should be, in theory, the last package we ever need for this. I am certain we will need to figure out the check.ps1 to accomodate. 

## Install Command

```%SystemRoot%\sysnative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -command .\install.ps1```

## Uninstall Command

```%SystemRoot%\sysnative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -command .\uninstall.ps1```

## Verification

Point to check.ps1.
